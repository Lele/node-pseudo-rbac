Permission library specifically designed to be used together with express but with no real dependencies.
In its simplest form it implements [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) but it let also define roles that user can take on with respect to the resource.

# PSEUDO RBAC
We started to build this library because our team needed a permission library that could evaluate the permissions of a user based on his/her role in the application and with respect to the resource taken into consideration.

In particular the library lets you:
  - define `role`s
  - define `resource`s and their own specific roles (called `resource-role`s)
  - define `permission`s for each role and resource-role with respect of each resource
  - define a list of query-conditions to filter out resources starting from user roles
  - use express middleware to manage user access on resources

Permissions are attribute-based, this means that you can specify a list of resource attributes to limit the effect of an action.

## EXAMPLE

For example, let's consider we have to build a ticketing system with these requirements:
  - user has one or more Roles among: Owner, Member, Customer
  - every ticket has an author, an assignee and 0 or more watchers
  - ticket can be assigned to one user

We can immediately see that every user has a Role in the application (Owner, Member or Customer) and one or more roles with respect to the ticket; we want to define permissions based on all of them.
For example, let's think about *read*, *update*, *assign* and *comment* permissions. We could state that:

#### read
  - the Owner can read `ANY` ticket
  - a Member can read  `ANY` ticket
  - a Customer can read **only**  tickets in which is involved (i.e. he is either the author or one of the watchers)

#### assign
  - the Owner can assign `ANY` ticket
  - a Member can assign tickets he/she has created (he/she is the author)
  - a Customer cannot assign tickets

#### comment
  - the Owner can comment `ANY` ticket
  - authors, watchers and assignees can comment their `OWN` tickets
  - a Customers cannot comment any tickets

#### update
  - the Owner can comment `ANY` ticket
  - authors can update their own tickets
  - watcher and assignees cannot update tickets
  - a Member can always update ticket titles in the tickets they are involved in

Our ticket library let the user define:
  - user Roles (Owner, Member, Customer)
  - resources (ticket, attachment)
  - role permissions

### Defining **ROLES**
First, we want to define user roles. Create a new file *roles.js* and insert the code that will define roles and their correspondent labels:

```js
  // roles as an array of objects defining the name and the label of each one
  const roles = [{
    name: 'owner',
    label: 'Owner'
  }, {
    name: 'member',
    label: 'Member'
  }, {
    name: 'customer',
    label: 'Customer'
  }]

  module.exports = roles
```

### Defining **RESOURCES**
Resources are more complicated to define.
For each resource we have to explicitly write:
- the `actions` that could be performed by users
- the `resourceRoles` that a user can have with respect to the resource itself
- the `resourceRolePermissions` that will define generic permission on the resource
- a custmom `getRoles` function that will return the roles and the resourceRoles of the user that will be evaluated

Let's create a new file *ticket.js* and define resource roles permissions such that `author`s, `watcher`s and `assignee`s can `read` and `comment` tickets.

```js
  // always define resources with actions
  // if the user can assume particular roles with respect to the resource you have to specify resource-roles
  // at this point you need to define a function that returns user roles and user resource-roles
  // if you specify resource-roles you probably want to specify generic resource-role permissions for every action
  module.exports = {
    name:'ticket',
    resourceRoles: ['author', 'watcher', 'assignee'],
    actions: ['read', 'assign', 'comment'],
    resourceRolePermissions: {
      author: {
        read: true,
        comment: true,
        update: true
      },
      watcher: {
        read: true,
        comment: true
      },
      assignee: {
        read: true,
        comment: true,
      }
    },
    getRoles: (user, ticket) => {
      const roles = user.roles
      const resourceRoles = []

      if (ticket.watchers.includes(user.id)) {
        resourceRoles.push('watcher')
      }
      if (ticket.author === user.id) {
        resourceRoles.push('author')
      }
      if (ticket.assignee === user.id) {
        resourceRoles.push('assignee')
      }
      return {
        roles,
        resourceRoles
      }
    }
  }
```
### Defining **ROLE PERMISSIONS**
Finally we can define roles permissions. The permissions-object defines permissions on every resource and role.
Possible values for each permission are:
- a `boolean`
- an array of strings defining which attributes the user has the permission on (especially useful for read and update permissions)
- a `resourceRolePermission` to overwrite generic resource role permissions

let's create a *permissions.js* file
```js
  const { ANY } = require('node-pseudo-rbac/core')

  module.exports = {
    ticket: {
      owner: {
      // owners can read, update, assign and comment regardless their role in the ticket
        read: ANY,
        assign: true,
        comment: ANY,
        update: ANY
      },
      // overwrite generic assign and update behaviour for Member role
      member: {
        read: ANY,
        assign: {
          author: true
        },
        update: ['title']
      },
      //Customers cannot comment any ticket
      customer: {
        comment: false
      }
    }
  }
```

### Configure `rbac`
now we have to configure the rbac instance with all the created conf. Let's do this in a *rbac.js* file

```js
  const Rbac = require('node-pseudo-rbac')
  const roles = require('./roles')
  const ticket = require('./ticket')
  const permissions = require('./permissions')

  const rbac = new Rbac()

  rbac.setRoles(roles)
  rbac.addResource(ticket)
  rbac.setPermissions(permissions)

  // or
  // const rbac = new Rbac({
  //  roles,
  //  ticket,
  //  permissions
  // })

  module.exports = rbac
```

### Apply the Permission **MIDDLEWARE**
```js
  const rbac = require('./rbac')
  const express = require('express');

  const app = express()

  app.param('ticketId', (req, res, next, id) => {
    req.ticket = myGetTicketFunc(id)
    next()
  })

  // req.user e req["resourceName"] should be defined like the resource we want to test permissions on
  app.get('tickets/:ticketId',myAuthMiddleware, rbac.canMiddleware('read', 'ticket'), myGetTicketController)
```

If the user has the permission to access the controller, then the library will place a `permissionRes` attribute in the req object.\
`permissionRes` has the following structure:

```ts
  {
    matches:Â [ // the list of permission matches (for debugging purposes)
      {
        match: {
          role?:string,
          resourceRole?:string
        },
        value: boolean | ANY,
        attributes: string[]
      }
    ],
    value: boolean | ANY, // the global value of the permission
    attributes: string[] // the list of attributes that the user can access for the specified action
  }
```

## QUERY-CONDITIONS
Another important feature lets you define for each resource - and for each role (including resource-roles) - the filters, you need to apply to your preferred DB, to list all the possible instances of that resource. \
Considering the previous example, we know that:
  - Members and Owners can read `any` ticket
  - Customers can read only tickets in which they are involved

### Defining **filterGetters**
Members and Customers can read `any` ticket, so there's no need to apply any filter to the resource. \
However we still have to define what does it means to be involved in a ticket and we can achieve this result describing the filters that characterize resource roles:

`ticket.js`
```diff
  // always define resources with actions
  // if the user can assume particular roles with respect to the resource you have to specify resource-roles
  // at this point you need to define a function that returns user roles and user resource-roles
  // if you specify resource-roles you probably want to specify generic resource-role permissions for every action
  module.exports = {
    name:'ticket',
  -   resourceRoles: ['author', 'watcher', 'assignee'],
  +   resourceRoles: [{
  +     name: 'author',
  +     resourceFilterGetter: (user) => {
  +       return [{ author: user.id }]
  +     }
  +   }, {
  +     name: 'watcher',
  +     resourceFilterGetter: (user) => {
  +       return [{ watchers: user.id }]
  +     }
  +   }, {
  +     name: 'assignee',
  +     resourceFilterGetter: (user) => {
  +       return [{ assignee: user.id }]
  +     }
  +   }],
    actions: ['read', 'assign', 'comment'],
    .
    .
    .
  }
```
Here we supposed to deal with a no-sql db but the resourceFilterGetter return-value could be any type of array.\
Even Roles can have filter getters and you can define them specifying the `resourceFilterGetters` property in the following way:

```js
  const Rbac = require('node-pseudo-rbac')

  const rbac = new Rbac()

  rbac.addRole('Tester', {
    resourceFilterGetters: {
      ticket: (user) => {
        return [{ tester: user.id }]
      }
    }
  })
```

### Applying the **filter middleware**
Applying the filter middleware is as simple as for any other middleware:

```js
  const rbac = require('./rbac')
  const express = require('express');

  const app = express()

  app.get('tickets/',myAuthMiddleware, rbac.filterMiddleware('ticket'), myTicketListController)
```
Once executed, the filter middleware will populate the `permissionFilters` property of the `req` object containing the array of your predefined filters accordingly to the roles of your user.

Obviously if a user has no **read** permission on the resource he will receive a 401 error. On the other hand, a user that can read `any` ticket, results in an empty `permissionFilters` array.


## PERMISSION DENIED HANDLER
You can customize the behavior of the middleware in case the user does not have any permission. You only need to add a `permissionDeniedCallback` to the Rbac definition, in this way:

```js
  const rbac = new Rbac({permissionDeniedCallback: (req, res) => {
    console.log("'tacci tua");
    res.sendStatus(401)
  }})
```
